QUADRIS README

BONUS FEATURES:
1) STL and smart pointers. As per the specifications for this bonus, all memory is handled via STL containers and smart pointers.
2) Command renaming. As per discussion on about this spec, command renaming became a bonus, and our app handles command renaming. To rename a command, execute the command `rename [old_command] [new_command]`
3) Level 5 implementation. Another level, implemented with a twist of 3 additional, complex shaped blocks has been introduced.

Toggling Bonus Features:
We determined that keeping Command renaming would be beneficial to the user and doens't directly affect gameplay so it were to be a permanent feature.
Similarly, memory management via STL and smart pointers is a permanent feature.
To disable level 5 (the only bonus that can be disabled), add command line flag `-nobonus` (make sure to have `-` as for all command line flags)/
